# TheHerd
A model-driven REST API and application for tracking COVID-19 vaccinations and symptoms.

For my SENG 6250 final project, I performed a model to text transformation using the following:

-- Modeling Language: RAML

-- IDE: VS Code

-- Transformation Tool: Mulesoft's API Designer

To use Mulesoft's API Designer:
